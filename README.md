## Tasks
### Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
In this task, I have implemented a classifiaction model using decision tree algorithm with help of scikit-learn library. Dataset used is IRIS data set. It consists of 150 observation of 4 features and 3 distinct label. Model is built on Decision Tree Classifier with 'gini' criteria. Earlier, data exploration has shown data set to be free of null values. Train and test set has formed with split of 20%. The model has shown an accuracy of 100%.
Check out implementation under [Task#3_TSF](https://github.com/saurabhap/GRIP-The-Sparks-Foundation/blob/main/TASK%233_TSF.ipynb).
To reproduce results, Clone the repository and run cells one-by-one.
